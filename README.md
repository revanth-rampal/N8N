# My n8n Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my repository for learning [n8n](https://n8n.io/), an extendable workflow automation tool. This repository serves as a collection of resources and a central point for tracking my learning progress.

## 🎯 Goal

My primary goal is to become proficient in using n8n to build robust and efficient workflows. I aim to understand its core concepts, explore its various nodes, and eventually build complex, multi-step automations for real-world use cases.

## 📈 Learning & Workflow Tracker

All details about my learning path, daily progress, notes, and the workflows I've built are logged in the Excel file below. This tracker is the single source of truth for this project.

* **Progress Tracker:** You can find my detailed progress and workflow information in the `progress.xlsx` file within this repository.
